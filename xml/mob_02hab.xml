			<abstract>This data set consists of digital data describing wetlands and uplands habitats for Mobile County in South Alabama for the year 2002. Wetlands were classified using the Cowardin, et al., wetland classification scheme to the level of salinity modifiers.  Uplands were classified using a customized classification scheme which can be cross-referenced to Anderson, et al.. The habitats were derived from interpretation of color infrared photography, mapped at 1:24,000. The Mobile County project includes all 37 USGS (7.5 minute series) quadrangles located within the county line.</abstract>
			<purpose>The intended use of this data set is to provide information to aid efforts in the conservation, restoration, creation, and enhancement of Alabama's coastal wetlands. The habitat data is used for an on going National Wetland Inventory project on time comparisons.</purpose>

			<attraccr>The accuracy of the attributes is dependent on the expertise of the photointerpreter and the processes involved in converting the delineation to digital form. All work conducted by the photointerpreter is double-checked by another photointerpreter. Upon conversion to a digital form, an on-screen comparison with the hard copy data is performed. The accuracy of these data is believed to be high, although no formal assessment was done.</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>ArcGIS software is used to create and maintain topological relationships between features. Polygonal features begin and end at the same point, contain no overshoots or undershoots, and contain a single label. Linear features are continuous where appropriate, i.e., dangling arcs are removed if they are not required.</logic>
		<complete>For the cartographic process (photointerpretation), accordance with nationally accepted mapping standards and conventions are followed. For the digital conversion process, conventions and standard check list methodologies in place for the time period were followed.</complete>
		<posacc>
			<horizpa>
				<horizpar>The accuracy of the horizontal positions is based on the accuracy of the georeferenced data source (which can be USGS DOQQs, DEMS, flight line center points, and/or calibration reports). The sources used vary from project to project. All USGS Mapping products adhere to the National Mapping Accuracy Standard.</horizpar>

				<procdesc>Cartographic Process - After acquiring aerial photography for the project area, stereo pairs were created and packaged according to the project boundaries. Maps for cartographic transformation were generated, using the same aerial photography, through means of rectification and mosaicking. The photos were interpreted using a Bausch and Lomb stereoscope at 10x magnification. Cartographic work was performed using a Zoom Transfer Scope, and magnification varied according to the scale of the source data (photography). All cartographic and photointerpretation processes adhere to National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) standards</procdesc>

		<overview>
			<eaover>Along with the associated topological attributes, the main attribute in this data set is the Habitat - This is the habitat classification for the area (to include polygonal and linear features). Wetlands are lands transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems where the water table is usually at or near the surface of the land is covered by shallow water. Uplands are terrestrial systems that do not exhibit wetland characteristics. The wetland classification system is hierarichial, with wetlands and deepwater habitats divided among 5 major systems at the broadest level. The five system include Marine, Estuarine, Riverine, Lacustrine, and Palustrine. These systems are further divided into subsystems which reflect hydrologic conditions. Below the subsystems are classes and subclasses describing vegetation or substrate, and modifiers relating to hydrology, soils, water chemistry, and man's activities.</eaover>
