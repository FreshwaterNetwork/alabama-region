      <abstract>This Updated Soil Survey product (DRAFT SUBJECT TO CHANGE) was funded through a contract between the Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Mobile Bay
Estuary. The product provides detailed information about soil properties and their distribution throughout the Southern Coastal Plain and Eastern Gulf Coast
Flatwoods landscapes in Mobile County, Alabama.  The updated product enables the end-user to have a more comprehensive understanding of soils and how they relate
to the management of the natural resources in the project area.The modern soil survey of Mobile County, Alabama was published in 1980 and has subsequently been
updated with this DRAFT SUBJECT TO CHANGE in 2017. The evaluation of the 7-LOX Soil Survey Office in Loxley,
AL indicates the original survey was mapped with broad soil map unit associations and does not meet current NCSS standards.
This data set is a digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey.
The information was prepared by NRCS Soil Scientists by on-screen digitizing, compiling information onto a geo-corrected base and/or by revising digitized maps
using remotely sensed and other information using ArcGIS 10.3 ArcInfo geospatial software.This data set consists of a digital soil map and attribute data.
The map data is in a soil survey area extent format and includes a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and non-soil areas that normally occur in a
repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. The soil map units are linked to attributes in the
National Soil Information System database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their 	properties.</abstract>
      <purpose>SSURGO depicts information about the kinds and distribution of
soils on the landscape. The soil map and data used in the SSURGO
product were prepared by soil scientists as part of the National
Cooperative Soil Survey.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Digital versions of hydrography, cultural features, and other
associated layers that are not part of the SSURGO data set may be
available from the primary organization listed in the Point of
Contact.</supplinf>

This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool
in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference
source. This is public information and may be interpreted by
organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on
needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate
application. Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to
reassign to the Natural Resources Conservation Service any

Photographic or digital enlargement of these maps to scales greater
than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation
of the data. If enlarged, maps do not show the small areas of
contrasting soils that could have been shown at a larger scale. The
depicted soil boundaries, interpretations, and analysis derived from
them do not eliminate the need for onsite sampling, testing, and
detailed study of specific sites for intensive uses. Thus, these data
and their interpretations are intended for planning purposes only.
Digital data files are periodically updated. Files are dated, and
users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.</useconst>

      <attraccr>The attribute accuracy is tested by manual
comparison of the source with hard copy plots and/or symbolized
display of the map data on an interactive computer graphic system.
Selected attributes that cannot be visually verified on plots or
on screen are interactively queried and verified on screen. In
addition, the attributes are tested against a master set of valid
attributes. All attribute data conform to the attribute codes in
the signed classification and correlation document and amendment(s).</attraccr>

    <logic>Certain node/geometry and topology GT- polygon/chain relationships
are collected or generated to satisfy topological requirements
(the GT-polygon corresponds to the soil delineation). Some of these
requirements include: chains must begin and end at nodes, chains
must connect to each other at nodes, chains do not extend through
nodes, left and right GT-polygons are defined for each chain
element and are consistent throughout, and the chains representing
the limits of the file are free of gaps. The tests of logical
consistency are performed using vendor software. All internal
polygons are tested for closure with vendor software and are checked
on hard copy plots. All data are checked for common soil lines (i.e.,
adjacent polygons with the same label). Edge locations generally do
not deviate from centerline to centerline by more than 0.01 inch.
Feature edges in this soil survey are not matched to those in George
County, Mississippi, and Jackson County, Mississippi, soil surveys.
Feature labels do not match.</logic>
    <complete>A map unit is a collection of areas defined and named in terms of
their soil components or miscellaneous areas or both. Each map
unit differs in some respect from all others in a survey area and
each map unit has a symbol that uniquely identifies the map unit
on a soil map. Each individual area, point, or line so identified
on the map is a delineation.

Soil Scientists identify small areas of soils or miscellaneous areas
that have properties and behavior significantly different than the
named soils in the surrounding map unit. These minor components
may be indicated as special features. If they have a minimal effect
on use and management, or could not be precisely located, they many
not be indicated on the map.

A map unit has specified kinds of soils or miscellaneous areas
(map unit components), each with a designated range in
proportionate extent. Map units include one or more kinds of soil
or miscellaneous area. Miscellaneous areas are areas that have little
or no recognizable soil.

Specific National Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures
were used in the classification of soils, design and name of map
units, and location of special soil features. These standards are
outlined in Agricultural Handbook 18, Soil Survey Manual, 1993,
USDA, NRCS; Agricultural Handbook 436, Soil Taxonomy, 1995,
USDA, NRCS; and all Amendments; Keys to Soil Taxonomy,
(current issue) USDA, NRCS; National Soil Survey
Handbook, title 430-VI,(current issue) USDA, NRCS.

The actual composition and interpretive purity of the map unit
delineations were based on data collected by scientists during
the course of preparing the soil maps. Adherence to National
Cooperative Soil Survey standards and procedures is based on
peer review, quality control, and quality assurance. Quality
control is outlined in the memorandum of understanding for the
soil survey area and in documents that reside with the Natural
Resources Conservation Service state soil scientist. Four kinds
of map units are used in soil surveys: consociations, complexes,
associations, and undifferentiated groups.

Consociations - Consociations are named for the dominant soil.
In a consociation, delineated areas use a single name from the
dominant component in the map unit. Dissimilar components are
minor in extent. The soil component in a consociation may be
identified at any taxonomic level. Soil series is the lowest
taxonomic level. A consociation that is named as a miscellaneous
area is dominantly that kind of area and minor components do not
significantly affect the use of the map unit. The total amount of
dissimilar inclusions of other components in a map unit generally
does not exceed about 15 percent if limiting and 25 percent if
nonlimiting. A single component of a dissimilar limiting inclusion
generally does not exceed 10 percent if very contrasting.

Complexes and associations - Complexes and associations consist
of two or more  dissimilar components that occur in a regularly
repeating pattern. The total amount of other dissimilar components
is minor extent. The following arbitrary rule determines whether
complex or association is used in the name. The major components
of an association can be separated at the scale of mapping. In
either case, because the major components are sufficiently different
in morphology or behavior, the map unit cannot be called a
consociation. In each delineation of a complex or an association,
each major component is normally present though their proportions
may vary appreciably from one delineation to another. The total
amount of inclusions in a map unit that are dissimilar to any of
the major components does not exceed 15 percent if limiting and
25 percent if nonlimiting. A single kind of dissimilar limiting
inclusion usually does not exceed 10 percent.

Undifferentiated groups - Undifferentiated groups consist of two
or more components that are not consistently associated
geographically and, therefore, do not always occur together in
the same map delineation. These components are included in the
same named map unit because their use and management are the same
or very similar for common uses. Generally they are grouped together
because some common feature, such as steepness, stoniness, or
flooding, determines their use and management. If two or more
additional map units would serve no useful purpose, they may be
included in the same unit. Each delineation has at least one of the
major components, and some may have all of them. The same principles
regarding the proportion of minor components that apply to
consociations also apply to undifferentiated groups. The same
principles regarding proportion of inclusion apply to
undifferentiated groups as to consociations.

Minimum documentation consists of three complete soil profile
descriptions that are collected for each soil added to the legend,
one additional per 3,000 acres mapped; three 10 observation
transects for each map unit, one additional 10 point transect per
3,000 acres.

A defined standard or level of confidence in the interpretive
purity of the map unit delineations is attained by adjusting the
kind and intensity of field investigations. Field investigations
and data collection are carried out in sufficient detail to name
map units and to identify accurately and consistently areas of
about 5 acres.</complete>

      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The accuracy of these digital data is based upon their
compilation to base maps that meet National Map
Accuracy Standards at a scale of 1 inch equals 1,000
feet. The difference in positional accuracy between the
soil boundaries and special soil features locations in the
field and their digitized map locations is unknown. The
locational accuracy of soil delineations on the ground varies
with the transition between map units.

For example, on long gently sloping landscapes the transition
occurs gradually over many feet. Where landscapes change
abruptly from steep to level, the transition will be very
narrow. Soil delineation boundaries and special soil features
generally were digitized within 0.01 inch of their locations on
the digitizing source. The digital map elements are edge matched
between data sets. The data along each quadrangle edge are
matched against the data for the adjacent quadrangle. Edge
locations generally do not deviate from centerline to centerline
by more than 0.01 inch.</horizpar>

        <procdesc>Mobile County, Alabama, had a previously
published soil survey, 1980, at scale of 1:20000. A detailed
evaluation of this survey showed that the soil delineations
and map unit components were accurate.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Soil map unit deleineations and special soil
features were manually compiled from the ratioed film positives
to stable base overlays registered to orthophotographs at 1:24000
scale by University of Nebraska, Conservation and Survey Division,
Lincoln, Nebraska. The Soil Survey quality control of the
compilation was done by the NRCS state office in Auburn,
AL. Overlays were scanned by Midwest Graphics, Milwaukee, WI,
with an Intergraph scanner at 300 dpi resolution. Digitizing
was done by Missouri NRCS Digitizing Unit staff. Raster editing
and vector conversion were done in LT4X 4.11. The vector files
were translated to dxf format and imported into Arc/Info 7.2.1.
Arc Macro Language programs were used to project, attribute, edge
match, error check the data in Arc/Info. Check plots of each
quadrangle were compared to the scanned source materials for accuracy.
Errors in the source material were reviewed and corrected by NRCS
personnel in Alabama. These corrections were incorporated into the
digital data by digitizing unit staff. Special features were manually
digitized in Arc/Info. All data were translated to DLG-3 optional
format in Arc/Info 7.2.1. The DLG-3 files were imported into
Arc/Info 7.2.1. and reviewed for adherence to SSURGO standards by
Missouri Digitizing Unit staff. Edits were made in Arc/Edit.
Edits were made to the survey boundary and soil lines and labels
along the boundary to achieve an acceptable join with adjacent
survey areas by digitizing unit staff members in consultation with
NRCS soil scientists in Alabama. New DLGs reflecting these edits
were written with ARC/INFO 7.2.1.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>The National Soil Information System data base
was developed by Natural Resources Conservation Service soil
scientists according to national standards. The soils data contained
in this SSURGO download represents the survey area at the time of
final correlation. The official data for program purposes is
contained in a dynamic database that is maintained at the local NRCS
field office. Interpretations are not stored in NASIS; they are
generated from the soils data stored in NASIS. The interpretations
included in this SSURGO download were generated from the soils data
included with this download. Interpretations generated at another
time may not match the included interpretations. For example, the
soil interpretations produced from this data set may not match the
interpretations in the published soil survey of Washington County,
Alabama. Most of the rules, evaluations, and properties used to
generate NASIS interpretations are controlled by the NRCS, National
Soil Survey Center, in Lincoln, Nebraska. Future modifications to
these rules, evaluations, or properties could result in different
interpretations than those in this download. Estimates of soil
properties are based on field examinations, on laboratory tests of
samples from the survey area, and on laboratory tests of samples
of similar soils in nearby areas. These estimated soil properties
include the range of grain-size distribution and Atterberg limits,
the engineering classification, and the physical and chemical
properties of the major layers of each soil. Some additional soil
properties (such as percent sand and silt) are calculated from
algorithms within NASIS.</procdesc>

soil survey area was downloaded from the Soil Data Mart on October 15, 2012.
The individual shapefiles were appended into a geodatabase for region 7.
The data were processed in ARCGIS 10.1 using a topology object with a
0.1 meter cluster tolerance for the purpose of eliminating gaps and overlaps
within the region 7 soils geodatabase.  Individual soil survey area data
were exported as shapefiles from the regional geodatabase.  A datum
transformation from NAD83 to WGS84 using the NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 datum
transformation method was applied to the data.  The data were checked with
the SSURGO Evaluation scripts provided by U.S. Department of Agriculture,
Natural Resources Conservation Service. The shapefiles were then uploaded

for polygon feature classes. The source materials include high-resolution 1 meter QL 2 DEM Lidar dataset for Mobile county, resampled to 3 meter with associated
raster-based layers to include the following; slope, cluster hillshade, topographic position index, contours, old mapping and latest available NAIP photography
imagery. In addition, on-screen digitizing was used plus automated data feature extraction from elevation derived raster layers for water bodies in the
vectorization process to compile and digitize at half the publication scale of 1:24,000. This mapping project was divided into five sections and was sent to
individual soil scientists for map compilation. Pre-mapping was conducted using LIDAR based derivatives such as hillshade, slope and relative position, as well
as scanned/georeferenced versions of previous mapping efforts.  Once the individual mapping sections were completed, they were merged together as one continuous
coverage for Mobile County, AL and Quality Control/Quality Assurance was completed to check for topology (gaps, overlaps and common lines), soil line placement
and attributing accuracy.The soils data being furnished to your organization is currently being updated in the National Soils Information System database and

    <overview>
      <eaover>Map Unit Delineations are closed polygons that may be dominated
by a single soil or miscellaneous area component plus allowable
similar or dissimilar soils, or they can be geographic mixtures
of groups of soils or soils and miscellaneous areas.

The map unit symbol uniquely identifies each closed map unit
delineation. Each symbol corresponds to a map unit name. The
map unit key is used to link to information in the National
Soil Information System tables.

Map Unit Delineations are described by the National Soil
Information System database. This attribute database gives the
proportionate extent of the component soils and the properties for
each soil. The database contains both estimated and measured data
on the physical and chemical soil properties and soil
interpretations for engineering, water management, recreation,
agronomic, woodland, range, and wildlife uses of the soil.

The National Soil Information System database contains static
metadata. It documents the data structure and includes such
information as what tables, columns, indexes, and relationships
are defined as well as a variety of attributes of each of these
database objects. Attributes include table and column
descriptions and detailed domain information.

The National Soil Information System database also contains a
distribution metadata. It records the criteria used for selecting
map units and components for inclusion in the set of distributed
data.

Special features are described in the feature table.  It includes an
area symbol, feature label, feature name, and feature description for
each special and ad hoc feature in the survey area.</eaover>
