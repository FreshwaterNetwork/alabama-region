Data_Quality_Information:
        Attribute_Accuracy:
                Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
                        Interpreted photos were quality checked by two photo
                        interpreters for attribute classification. Field verification was
                        performed by local scientists for areas where attribute
                        24,000 maps were checked by cartographic personnel for
                        line and labelworks. The attribute accuracy was tested by
                        manually comparing hard copy plots of the digital data with
                        the source materials. When attributes could not be visually
                        verified on plots they were interactively queried and verified
                        on screen. In addition, the attributes were compared against
                        a master set of valid attributes
        Logical_Consistency_Report:
                ArcGIS software was used to create and maintain
                topological relationships between features. There are no
                duplicate features, but coincident lines are maintained
                between data layers where appropriate. Polygonal features
                begin and end at the same point, contain no overshoots or
                undershoots, and contain a single label. Linear features
                are continuous where appropriate, i.e., dangling arcs are
                removed if they are not required.

                        Process_Description:
                                Aerial Photo Acquisition
                                A Cessna T207 Skywagon was used for acquiring aerial
                                photography primarily on July 19,20,and 22, 2002. A flight
                                log is included as Appendix A. Three Perdido Bay flight
                                lines were reflown July 31 because of clouds during the
                                original July 22 flight. Flights were conducted during
                                morning hours of appropriate sun angles (35 to 45°). AGFA
                                x100 true color film was used for the aerial photography.
                                A Zeiss RMK TOP 15 mapping camera acquired color
                                24,000 scale with 60% forward overlap and
                                30% sidelap. The TOP 15 camera was integrated with an
                                airborne GPS unit (ABGPS) and an inertial measurement
                                unit (IMU). WorldWide Mission Planning (WWMP) software
                                was used to plan the aerial photography mission. A
                                Computer-Controlled Navigation System (CCNS4) provided
                                guidance for the aircraft and camera control. Aircraft
                                position was controlled with the CCNS4 system and an
                                on-board GPS flight navigation 2000A system by Trimble.
                                The TOP 15 camera was equipped with forward motion
                                compensation (FMC) and Zeiss T-AS gyro-stabilized
                                suspension mount to assure verticality of the optical axis.
                                An airborne Leica 9500 unit GPS System captured
                                one-second positional updates in order to record the
                                position of the photo principal point and the time of firing of
                                the camera shutter. The airborne 9500 GPS unit and the
                                ground differential GPS unit recorded GPS satellite signals
                                into 4 Mb PCMCIA Type I data cards.
                                Camera orientations were recorded along the flight lines.
                                The aircraft was equipped with the APPLANIX POS system
                                mounted with the camera, utilizing an Inertial Measurement
                                Unit (IMU to enhance the aerotriangulation process by
                                using the airborne GPS control to orient angles. The
                                ABGPS and IMU systems provided horizontal position and
                                the orientation parameters of the camera.
                                Photographic System Calibration
                                The Zeiss TOP 15 camera, Serial no. 145843, Lens No.
                                145912 was calibrated September 06, 2000 as
                                documented in the USGS Camera Calibration Report No.
                                OSL/2677. Noteworthy is the Area Weighted Average
                                Resolution (AWAR) of 101 cycles/mm.
                                The ABGPS / IMU systems were previously boresight
                                calibrated by a photographic flight February 15, 2002 over
                                an area having 16 known high order ground survey points
                                that were photo identifiable. A test aerotriangulation run
                                was made on the trial run aerial photography to determine
                                the quality of performance of the ABGPS / IMU systems.
                                The ABGPS positional data and the IMU orientation data
                                were combined and post-processed for X,Y,Z output and
                                subsequently compared with the test aerotriangulation
                                X,Y,Z output. Any misalignments between the two data
                                sets were calculated and calibrated adjustments to the IMU
                                were made to refine the orientation angles. Upon
                                completion of the mission, the GPS data was processed
                                using differential software that combined the ground GPS
                                survey phase measurements and the airborne GPS phase
                                measurements.
                                Digital Scanners
                                The SDM Team used a USGS-approved Zeiss Photoscan
                                photogrammetric scanner to scan roll-fed aerial photography
                                negatives at 21 microns to produce raw tif images of 0.504
                                m pixel size.
                                GPS Photo Control Surveys
                                Twenty photo identifiable GPS ground control points were
                                established at strategic points along the perimeter and
                                within the interior of the project area. The ground surveyed
                                control points were further intensified in the
                                aerotriangulation process by using the ABGPS / IMU
                                principal point coordinates and generating photogrammetric
                                control points.
                                Fully Analytical Aerotriangulation
                                Softcopy aerotriangulation was accomplished with ZI
                                Imaging ISAT software. In the softcopy environment,
                                mensuration was computer-aided by image matching
                                techniques. The imaging software correlated digital imagery
                                patches common to both frames of a stereomodel in order
                                to generate photogrammetric control points. The number of
                                patches within each stereomodel to be correlated was
                                manually determined. Ground surveyed photo control
                                points were visually identified and assigned coordinates
                                furnished by ground surveyors. The ground control points
                                served as the framework within which the generated
                                photogrammetric control points were adjusted.
                                The aerotriangulation process generated control (pass
                                points) for each frame to include tie points between
                                adjacent flight lines. A total of 1,369 X,Y,Z control points
                                was generated. The root mean square (RMS) errors of the
                                final block adjustment to the ground survey control were as
                                0.04 meters. The root mean square errors of the 0.072
                                meters, 0.115 meters. Orthophoto Workstation
                                Instrumentation and Software Orthophoto production was
                                accomplished on Dell workstations using ZI Imaging
                                OrthoPro and I/RAS C software. The output of the
                                aerotriangulation process was
                                used to create a digital elevation model (DEM), or elevation
                                surface, which removed imagery displacements in the
                                production of the orthophotography. Each 9" x 9" photo
                                frame was furnished as an ortho product with a final
                                resampled pixel resolution of 0.61 meters.

                                Surveys for beds of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)
                                were conducted on the Alabama Gulf Coast during the
                                summer and fall months of 2002 in an effort to provide
                                baseline inventory data on the status of biologically
                                important species of native aquatic plants occurring within
                                the coastal regions of Mobile and Baldwin Counties.
                                Invasive, non-native taxa such as Hydrilla (Hydrilla verticillata:
                                Hydrocharitaceae) and Eurasian milfoil (Myriophyllum spicatum: Haloragraceae)
                                were also targeted to determine the extent of infestation
                                within the study area. Areas covered within the two-county
                                region include Mobile Bay, the lower Mobile and Tensaw
                                River Delta and adjoining waters along the immediate coast
                                of Alabama. Aerial photography was flown during a
                                two-week period in July 2002 by Southeastern Digital
                                Mapping Inc. (SDM). The resulting images
                                were then digital rectified and converted into digital
                                orthoquads. Examination of aerial
                                photography was used to identify specific areas of SAV. A
                                total of 250 ground-truthing points were visited in the
                                field to verify the presence of SAV and to determine 
                                species composition. A total of sixteen vascular plant species
                                representing ten taxonomic families were recorded during
                                the survey of the Alabama Gulf Coast. Algal
                                species (e.g. Chara, Nitella), were not included in this
                                survey. In addition, data was also collected for several
                                other aquatic and wetland species, which although typically
                                occur as free floating or emergent, include many non-native
                                and invasive taxa.

                        areas containing SAV. This mapping program will provide a
                        basis for identification of future changes from the current
                        distribution and types of SAV resources within the Mobile
                        estuary.
